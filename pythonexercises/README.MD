PYTHON
High-level
Interpreted - complilation is not manual - it simply executes the codebase line by line
general-purpose - web dev - backend - server scripting , data science ....
extensive libs.
oop - object oriented programming
dynamically typed - python will try to assign a data type to a value , sometimes we need to be specific
Fundamentals
basics a. syntax and structure

indentation - use 4 spaces to define code blocks
no usage of semi colon
comments in python start with #
b. variables c. data types d. input and output e. Type casting f. python operators g. data type operations
control flows a. conditional statements - if ,elif, else b. loops

functions

collections

modules and imports

oop basics

error handling

virtual environments and packages

Python Operators
Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values

Arithmetic Operators : these perform common math operations +, - , * , / , % (modulus : returns the reminder from a division operation)

Assignment Operators : these operators assign values to variables = , += ( x += 3 : x = x + 3 ) , -= , *= , /= , %=

Comparison Operators : these operators are used to compare two values , the result is normally a boolean result True or False == , != , > , < , >= , <= ,

Logical Operators : these operators are used to chain / combine conditional statements / comparison operators a. and : return true if both statements are true b. or : returns true if one of the statements is true c. not : reverses the result , returns false if the result is true

Identity Operators : used to compare objects , not if they are equal , but if they are the same object. a. is : returns true if both variables are the same object b. is not : returns true if both variables are not the same objects

Membership Operators : used to test if a sequence is presented in an object a. in : returns true if a sequence with the value specified is present b. not in : returns true if a sequence with specified value is not present

Bitwise Operators : used to compare values in a binary nature a. and = & True = 1 False = 0 b. or = | c. not = ~ , !

Data Types Operations
In built operations/methods that enable us to manipulate data Each Data type has its own variation for the built operations

Numbers -> type casting , arithmetics operations

FUNCTIONS and Single Responsibility Pattern : SRP
Each function , class or module should have only one reason to change one function = one purpose

Why it matters
Modularity - each function will do one thing well
Maintability - change one function without affecting the others
Reusability - reuse the single functions elsewhere within our codebase
Testability - each part can be unit-tested independetly
summarize.py
Three core responsibilities

Input handling - reading the input from the terminal
Data processing - computing the stats (count, min, max , average etc..)
Output formatting- printing and error reporting
Modules :: this points to files/tools that have ready functions to enable executions of specifics task
Introduce to scripts using import statement
OOP : Object Oriented Programming
this is organizing our code around objects -> Objects -> attributes : data methods :: actions , independent action , actions that affect the data

eCommerce System

users -> role, full_name, id, password , email , -> login() , register(), resetPassword() , updateProfile()
products -> category, price , title , descriptions, -> add(), display() , updateProducts()
payments -> amount, gateway, useridentity -> makePayment() , generateReports()
Building blocks of OOP
Class : blueprint
Object(single entity with attributes and methods) : instance of the class
Dog class -> attributes - > name -> breed -> age objects -> different dogs created from the blueprint

Python treats everything like an object

FOUR PILLARS OF OOP - a guide on desing thinking for outr oop approach
Encapsulation - bundle data and behaviour(methods) in one place (class)
keep related things together
keeps data safe and ensures no mix up data / behaviour relative to the domain
Abstraction - hiding complex details and showing only the important stuff
simple methods that hide complex process
Inheritance - allows once class to use atrributes and methods of another -reuse code , make relationships between our classes more clear
Polymorphism - different objects can respond to the same method in different ways
DOMAIN EXAMPLE : RETAIL SYSTEM
Customers - data and methods sets that are required to represent this ddomain as code
Products - data and methods sets that are required to represent this ddomain as code
Orders - data and methods sets that are required to represent this ddomain as code
Payments - data and methods sets that are required to represent this ddomain as code
Object relationships : The relationship to be established using objects in the system
one to one relationship : object to object
one to many relationship : object to multiple objects
many to many relationship : association class set up : many objects to many objects
